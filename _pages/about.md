I am an associate professor at the School of Mathematical Sciences at Hebei Normal University, China. My research interests focus on Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Northwestern Polytechnical University. Both my master's and Ph.D. studies were conducted at Nanjing University under the guidance of Professor Yaojun Chen. Meanwhile, my Ph.D. studies also took place at the University of Twente (The Netherlands), where I was advised by Professor Hajo Broersma. This was part of a Joint Ph.D. Program sponsored by the China Scholarship Council.
